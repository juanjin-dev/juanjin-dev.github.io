> Hey, I'm writing a post for the first time in here. If you see something wrong, give me feedback.

> You may have different development environment. I'm using [Ubuntu 24.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Zephyr 4.0](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/v4.0-branch). In addition, I'll use [Blackpill F411CE](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F411CEU6-WeAct-Black-Pill-V2.0.html) board for practice.
